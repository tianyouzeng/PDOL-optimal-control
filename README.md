## Files

The name of the files suggests their functionality. For example:

- [`burgers_train_cts_deeponet_hc.py`](https://github.com/tianyouzeng/PDOL-optimal-control/blob/main/burgers_train_cts_deeponet_hc.py) is the source code for training the DeepONet model that approximates the control-to-state operator for the optimal control of stationary Burgers equations.
- [`semilinparab_train_gradadj_fno3d_hc.py`](https://github.com/tianyouzeng/PDOL-optimal-control/blob/main/semilinparab_train_gradadj_fno3d_hc.py) is the source code for training the FNO model that approximates the adjoint operator of the Fr√©chet derivative of the control-to-state operator in the optimal control of semilinear parabolic equations.
- [`bilinparab_optimize_fno3d.py`](https://github.com/tianyouzeng/PDOL-optimal-control/blob/main/bilinparab_optimize_fno3d.py) is the source code for solving the bilinear optimal control of parabolic equations by the trained FNO surrogate models.

Besides the files in the root directory:

- The [`models`](https://github.com/tianyouzeng/PDOL-optimal-control/tree/main/models) and [`utils`](https://github.com/tianyouzeng/PDOL-optimal-control/tree/main/utils) folders contain the class definitions of DeepONet, MIONet and FNO. They also contains utility classes and functions for training and evaluation.
- The [`data`](https://github.com/tianyouzeng/PDOL-optimal-control/tree/main/data) folder contains the source code we used for generating training sets and testing sets.
- The [`trained_models`](https://github.com/tianyouzeng/PDOL-optimal-control/tree/main/trained_models) folder contains the models trained by the code in this repository.
- The [`trad_alg`](https://github.com/tianyouzeng/PDOL-optimal-control/tree/main/trad_alg) folder contains the implementaion of some traditional numerical algorithms that we compared with in the paper.
- The [`env`](https://github.com/tianyouzeng/PDOL-optimal-control/tree/main/env) folder contains an example [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest) environment for running the code.
